This is note for vedio: (Because I dont have microphone on my pc, so i type here)
you can find this document under /code/

1.  I am using Web Server for Chrom run this html 5 program.
    Link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en

2.  When open the web page, there is nothing show up, that is because data haven't been load. What you need to
    do is chick button "Load Data" on up right corner.
    2-1. Data Title is use to change the web page title. (you can left it empty).
    2-2. Data URL is where you going to enter csv data link. (There are some url link under code/data/url.txt)
    2-3. After you ender the url click Load button to load data. 
         PS: There is a default url which I hard code in side. so you can also load without enter anything.

3.  After you Load data, It will still not display because you need to choose the which columns to display in graph.
    For set up columns you can click on white card. 
    3-1. First row are Bivariate Scatterplot and Bar Chart. Second row are Correlation Matrix and Scatterplot Matrix.
         Thrid row is Parallel Coordinates.
    3-2. In Bivariate Sctterplot has 2 selection. one for x-axis, one for y-axis.
    3-3. In Bar Chart has 3 selection, two is for x and y axis. one is Method. Range is range of data. Filter is use
         filter the x-axis columns. pattern is "<name>,<name>,...<name>," no space between. ex: 1,2,3,4,5
    3-4. In Correlation Matrix you can add as many columns as you want. for add column just click on "ADD COLUMN" button
         for delete column, just choose "{{DELETE}}" in selection.
    3-5. The add and delete columns in Scatterplot Matrix is same as Correlation Matrix.
    3-6. The add and delete columns in Parallel Coordinates is same as Correlation Matrix. but it have brush in the graph.
         I will show how to use in the video.

================================================================================================================================

Now I am going to show 2 "data story" 
1.  What are factors will affect that player to win the game.
    1-1. First I should know what columns i should look at. So i am going look at Correlation Matrix.
    1-2. As you can see on the top bar, red color is negative correction, purple is positive correction.
    1-3. Now we should look at "win" row. as you can see Red blocks are "deaths " and "duration". Purple block are 
         "assists", "gpm"herodamge", "kill", "kpm", "xp", "rune_pick". 
         That mean if player dead too much, or the duration of a game is too long, player are more likely too lose the
         game. 
    1-4. For purple block we are going to look at Parallel Coordinates.
    1-5. As you can see "kills", "xpm", and "gpm" has great effect on game win, the value of "kills", "xpm", and "gpm" are above 
         to 1/3 of them total value.
    1-6. For "herodamage", "assists", "rune_pick" we can not get too much information from it. But if we move brush on the "win"
         columns to the bottom, we can see, those value in the lose game only few of them are above to 50% of them total value.
         which mean if those value are too low, this player is more like to loss the game.
    
2.  What are factory will affect that player to earn gold.
    2-1. Same as first one, I am going to start with Correlation Matrix.
    2-2. We can also see totalgold and gpm are look similar, that is because gpm = totalgold / duration. As we can see                   "herodamge","kills", "last_hit", "rune_pickups", has higher correlation value with gold.
    2-3. Now we look at Parallel Coordinates, the "last_hits" and "kills" are effect on "gpm", because "gpm" grow as "last_hits"
         and "kills" grow. 

That is all, thank you for watching. :)
